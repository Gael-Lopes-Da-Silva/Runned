### ‚ùì How to run or buidl
To run, you will need to download the lua interpreter. You can find it [here](https://luabinaries.sourceforge.net/download.html). <br>
Then, run the following command:

```console
$ lua .\src\runned.lua
```

To build, you will need to download a lua compiler. You can find the one I use [here](https://github.com/samyeyo/rtc). <br>
Then, run the following command:

```console
$ rtc -s -c -o .\build\runned.exe .\src\runned.lua
```

If you want to download a build, check the [build](./build/) folder.
